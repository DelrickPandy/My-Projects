This C++ program allows you to input students' names and their test scores, calculates their average score, assigns a grade based on that average, and then displays the results. Here's a detailed explanation of how it works:

Program Breakdown:
Libraries Used:

#include <iostream>: For input and output operations.
#include <string>: To work with strings.
#include <vector>: To use dynamic arrays (vectors).
#include <iomanip>: For formatting output (e.g., setting decimal precision).

Functions:

calculateAverage(int scores[], int numScores): This function calculates the average score from an array of scores.
It sums up all the scores and then divides by the number of scores to get the average.

determineGrade(double avgScore): This function assigns a letter grade based on the average score:

A for scores 90 and above
B for scores between 80 and 89
C for scores between 70 and 79
D for scores between 60 and 69
F for scores below 60

displayResults(const vector<string>& names, const vector<double>& averages, const vector<char>& grades, int numStudents): This function displays the results in a formatted table:

The student's name
The average score (with two decimal places)
The grade assigned to the student.

Main Logic:

The user is prompted to enter the number of students.
A dynamic array of vectors is created to store the names, averages, and grades for each student.

For each student:
Their name is entered.
The number of test scores is entered.
Each test score is validated (between 0 and 100).
The average score and grade are calculated using the calculateAverage() and determineGrade() functions, respectively.
After processing all the students, the displayResults() function is called to show the output.
